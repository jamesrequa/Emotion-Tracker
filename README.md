# Mimic Me Emotion Tracker (work-in-progress)


## Overview

This project tracks faces in video and identifies facial expressions. Each face is tagged with an appropriate emoji next to it. Then I turn this into a game where the player needs to mimic a random emoji displayed by the computer

I am using [Affectiva](http://www.affectiva.com/)â€™s Emotion-as-a-Service API for this project.
